         "body":"In lesson 3.5 on multi-level judgments, the last slide says that ML-judgments can run on a scale of [1,r] where r (rank) \u003e 2.\n\nSo in a very fine-grained ML-judgment system where the number of ranks = 10, one could have a document score of 1 for the least-relevant one, 2 for a slightly more relevant document, etc. up to a score of 10 for the most relevant document, as far as I understand.\n\nWhy, though, would we not be able to apply a score of 0 for the \"non-relevant\" documents? It seems intuitively valid to grant a score of zero to a document that the user has gained nothing from processing it. Is there any reason not to?",
