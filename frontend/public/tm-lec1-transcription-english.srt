1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,800
In this lecture we give an overview of

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,910
text mining and analytics.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,682
First, let's define the term text

4
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,430
mining and the term text

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,423
analytics.

6
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:22,550
The title of this course is called Text

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,500
Mining and Analytics,

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,310
but the two terms text mining and text

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,070
analytics are actually roughly the

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,040
same. So we are not going to really

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,710
distinguish them, and we're going to

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,450
use them interchangeably.

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,150
But the reason why we have chosen to

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,630
use both terms in the title is because

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,660
there is also some subtle difference

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,400
if you look at the two phrases

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,160
literally.

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,360
Mining emphasizes more on the process,

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,030
so it gives us an algorithmic

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,350
view of the problem.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,770
Analytics on the other hand

22
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,960
emphasizes more on the result

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,060
or having a problem in mind.

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,700
We're going to look at the text data

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,620
to help us solve a problem.

26
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,410
But again, as I said, we can treat

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,280
these two terms roughly the same,

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,440
and I think in the literature you

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,030
probably will find the same.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,300
So we're not going to really

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,870
distinguish them in the course.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Both text mining and text analytics

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,290
mean

34
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,800
that we want to turn text data into

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,090
high quality information or actionable

36
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,740
knowledge.

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,020
So in both cases we have the problem of

38
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,070
dealing with a lot of text data and we

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,850
hope to turn these text data into

40
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,170
something more useful to us than the

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,260
raw text data.

42
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,760
And here we distinguish two different

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,270
results

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,240
one is high quality information,

45
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,630
the other is actionable knowledge.

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,590
Now, sometimes the boundary between the two

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,840
is not so clear,

48
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,310
but I also want to say a little bit

49
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,240
about these

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,650
two different angles of the result of

51
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,600
text mining.

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,100
In the case of high quality information

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,960
we refer to more concise

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,800
information

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,830
about the topic,

56
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,880
which might be much easier for humans

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,000
to digest than the raw text data.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,850
For example, you might face a lot of

59
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,260
reviews of a product.

60
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,880
The more concise form of the

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,160
information would be very concise

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
summary of the major opinions about the

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,860
features of the product.

64
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,940
Positive about, let's say, battery life

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,790
of a laptop.

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
Now, this kind of results are very

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,380
useful to help people digest text data,

68
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,450
and so this is to minimize the human

69
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,670
effort in consuming text data in some

70
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,070
sense.

71
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,010
The other kind of output is actionable

72
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,590
knowledge.

73
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,410
Here we emphasize

74
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,290
the utility of the information or

75
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,380
knowledge we discover from text data.

76
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,290
It's actionable knowledge for some

77
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,650
decision problem, or some actions to

78
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,050
take.

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,700
For example, we might be able to

80
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,680
determine which product is more

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,060
appealing to us all,

82
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,800
a better choice for a shopping

83
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,380
decision.

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,430
Now,

85
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,950
such an outcome

86
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,630
could be called actionable

87
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,970
knowledge because a consumer can

88
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,190
take the knowledge and make a decision

89
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,500
and act on it.

90
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,590
So in this case, text mining supplies

91
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,000
knowledge for optimal decision making.

92
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,510
But again, the two are not so clearly

93
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,710
distinguished, so we don't necessarily

94
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,150
have to make a distinction.

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,920
Text mining is also related to text

96
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,610
retrieval,

97
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,890
which is an essential component in any

98
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,480
text mining systems.

99
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,540
Now text retrieval refers to finding

100
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,270
relevant information from a large

101
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,580
amount of text data.

102
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,660
So I've taught another separate MOOC

103
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,440
on text retrieval and search engines,

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,500
where we discussed various techniques

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,860
for text retrieval.

106
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,370
If you have taken that MOOC, you

107
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,210
will find some overlap

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,380
and it would be useful to know the

109
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,950
background of text retrieval for

110
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,230
understanding some of the topics in

111
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,170
text mining.

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,480
But if you have not taken that MOOC it's

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,210
also fine, because in this more context

114
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,560
mining and analytics we're going to

115
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,940
repeat some of the key concepts that

116
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,390
are relevant for text mining.

117
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,560
But at the high level, let me also

118
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
explain the relation between text

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,490
retrieval and text mining.

120
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,465
Text retrieval is very useful for text

121
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,360
mining in two ways:

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,920
First, text retrieval can be a

123
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,450
pre-processor for text mining, meaning

124
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,160
that it can help us turn big text data

125
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,350
into a relatively small amount of most

126
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,670
relevant text data, which is often

127
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,710
what's needed for solving a particular

128
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,330
problem.

129
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,070
And in this sense, text retrieval also

130
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,420
helps minimize human effort.

131
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,120
Text retrieval is also needed for

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,730
knowledge provenance and this roughly

133
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,945
corresponds to the interpretation of

134
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:54,320
text mining as turning text data into

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,030
actionable knowledge.

136
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,719
Once we find the patterns in text data

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,030
or actionable knowledge,

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,528
we generally would have to verify the

139
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,296
knowledge by looking at the original

140
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,847
text data so the users would have to

141
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,950
have some text retrieval support to go

142
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,499
back to the original text data to

143
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,810
interpret the pattern, or to better

144
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,009
understand the knowledge or to verify

145
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,525
whether the pattern is really reliable.

146
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,636
So this is a high level introduction to

147
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:24,390
the concept of text mining and

148
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,820
the relation between text mining and

149
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,690
retrieval.

150
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,520
Next, let's talk about text data as a

151
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,370
special kind of data.

152
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,600
Now it's interesting to

153
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,390
view text data as data

154
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,450
generated by

155
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,380
humans as subjective sensors.

156
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,670
So this slide shows an

157
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,180
analogy between text data and non

158
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,730
text data and between humans as

159
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,426
subjective sensors and physical sensors

160
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:13,160
such as network sensor or

161
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,900
thermometer.

162
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,340
So in general, a sensor will monitor

163
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,720
the real world in some way it will

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,159
sense some signal from the real world

165
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,420
and then would report the signal as

166
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,670
data

167
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,980
in various forms, for example, a

168
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,170
thermometer would watch the temperature

169
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,640
of

170
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,920
real world and then will report the

171
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,390
temperature in particular format.

172
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,320
Similarly a geo sensor would sense the

173
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,000
location and then report

174
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,120
the location specification, for example

175
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,860
in the form of longitude value and

176
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,940
lattitude value.

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,750
Network sensor would monitor network

178
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,290
traffic or activities in the network

179
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,270
and report some digital format of data.

180
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,410
Similarly, we can think of humans as

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,650
subjective sensors that would observe

182
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,770
the real world

183
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,890
from some perspective, and then humans

184
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,590
would express what they have observed

185
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,990
in the form of text data.

186
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,370
So in this sense human is actually

187
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,560
a subjective sensor

188
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,590
that would also sense what's happening

189
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,120
in the world and then express what's

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,655
observed in the form of data,

191
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,960
in this case text data.

192
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,280
Now looking at the text data in this

193
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,720
way has the advantage of being able to

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,060
integrate all kinds of data together,

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,310
and that's indeed needed in most data

196
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,510
mining problems.

197
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,330
So here we are looking at

198
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,560
the general problem of data mining,

199
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,730
and in general we would be dealing with

200
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,870
a lot of data about our world

201
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,080
that are related to a problem.

202
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,910
And in general would be dealing with

203
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,420
both non text data and text data and of

204
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,710
course the non text data are usually

205
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,500
produced by physical sensors.

206
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,350
And those non text data can be also of

207
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,340
different formats - 

208
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,410
numerical data or categorical or

209
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,750
relational data or multimedia data

210
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,380
like a video or speech.

211
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,250
So, these non text data are often very

212
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,980
important in some problems.

213
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,170
But text data is also very important,

214
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,150
mostly because they contain a lot of

215
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,910
semantic content and they often contain

216
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,350
knowledge about the users, especially

217
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,930
preferences and opinions of users.

218
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,790
So, but by treating text data as the

219
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,403
data observed from human sensors, we

220
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:10,560
can treat all these data together in

221
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,723
the same framework. So, data

222
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,720
mining problem is basically to turn

223
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,150
such data, turn all the data into

224
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,100
actionable knowledge that we can take

225
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,200
the advantage to change the real world,

226
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,565
of course, for better.

227
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:30,020
So this means that data mining problem

228
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,789
is basically taking a lot of data as

229
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,330
input and giving actionable knowledge

230
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,460
as output. Inside the data mining

231
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,630
module

232
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,855
you can also see we have a number of

233
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:46,134
different kinds of mining algorithms

234
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:48,470
and this is because for different

235
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,388
kinds of data we generally need

236
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:54,731
different algorithms for mining the

237
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:55,399
data.

238
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,110
For example, video data might require

239
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,460
computer vision to understand video

240
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,040
content and that would facilitate the

241
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,700
more effective mining and

242
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,660
we also have a lot of general

243
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,490
algorithms that are applicable to all

244
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,980
kinds of data, and those algorithms of

245
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,270
course are very useful,

246
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,040
although for a particular kind of data

247
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,180
we generally want to also develop

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,300
special algorithms.

249
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,440
So this course will cover specialized

250
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,990
algorithms that are particularly useful

251
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,470
for mining text data.
