# Course Project

Our group has built a back-end application to cohesively integrate the instructor’s Coursera lecture videos with additional information about significant terms in the lectures. The CampusWire postings and the course textbook were mined for references to these significant keywords. 

Our application provides a text area on the webpage to display the most significant keywords from the course material for each week. Following the keyword, the user will find links to CampusWire postings that reference the keyword as well as the page number and extracted text from the course textbook for this keyword.

Our application alleviates the inconvenience of navigating in and out of Coursera to resolve questions about new concepts and terminology.  By incorporating all of the relevant information directly on the webpage, the user will have a more focused and productive learning experience. The techniques applied to this project demonstrate mastery of both text access and text mining.
